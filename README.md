The 2024CBMS Dashboard.pbix file is the main output of the project. This can be loaded to Power BI to view the entire dashboard. generator.py is the script that generates random dataset weighted with actual census.

If Power BI is not installed in your system, you may refer to the pdf file instead of importing the .pbix file.
